                                strong Abstract:
                                | This project utilizes regression analysis to assess the depreciation rates of used car brands in Saudi Arabia, focusing on mileage as a determining factor. Two datasets were consolidated and cleaned to enhance data quality. Three regression models - Random Forest, Linear Regression, and XGBoost - were employed to predict car prices and evaluate depreciation rates. XGBoost emerged as the most accurate model, revealing insights into which car brands maintain their value best.

                        p During my internship at Digital Global Systems from May 2022 to August 2022, I undertook various projects aimed at enhancing the functionality and efficiency of radio frequency boards.

                        p One of my primary responsibilities involved developing programs in C to adjust the gain levels of radio frequency boards. Through meticulous coding and rigorous testing, I successfully implemented algorithms that precisely modulated the gain settings, improving the performance and reliability of the boards.

                        p Furthermore, I spearheaded the optimization of a Python program designed to record and graph gain data obtained from the radio frequency boards. By leveraging advanced libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I streamlined data processing and visualization, enabling our team to extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions regarding board calibration and performance monitoring.

                        p In addition to gain modulation, I played a pivotal role in data acquisition and analysis by creating Python scripts to download FCC frequency data and conduct thorough preprocessing and cleaning. These scripts automated the tedious task of collecting regulatory information, ensuring compliance and accuracy in our operations while saving valuable time for the team.

                        p Furthermore, I had the opportunity to showcase our work at the radio frequency conference in Las Vegas. Our optimized Python program, coupled with visually compelling graphs generated using Matplotlib, garnered significant attention and appreciation from industry experts, reaffirming the impact of our contributions on the RF engineering community.

                        p Throughout the internship, I encountered various challenges, including debugging complex C programs and optimizing Python scripts for efficient data handling. However, through perseverance and collaboration with my colleagues, I was able to overcome these obstacles and deliver high-quality solutions that exceeded expectations.

                        p This internship provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in software development, data analysis, and RF engineering within the telecommunications industry. It enhanced my proficiency in programming languages such as C and Python, as well as my familiarity with essential data manipulation tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

                        p One of the most rewarding aspects of this experience was witnessing the tangible impact of my contributions on the company's products and processes.
