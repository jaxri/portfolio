                                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                                This project utilizes regression analysis to assess the depreciation rates of used car brands in Saudi Arabia, focusing on mileage as a determining factor. Two datasets were consolidated and cleaned to enhance data quality. Three regression models - Random Forest, Linear Regression, and XGBoost - were employed to predict car prices and evaluate depreciation rates. XGBoost emerged as the most accurate model, revealing insights into which car brands maintain their value best.

                                <strong>Introduction:</strong>
                                The COVID-19 pandemic and economic factors have led to a surge in the used car market in Saudi Arabia, prompting a shift in consumer preferences towards more affordable options. Understanding the factors influencing used car depreciation rates has become crucial. This project aims to provide insights into which cars retain their value the most, aiding consumers in making informed purchasing decisions.

                        <p>During my internship at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from May 2023 to August 2023, I had the opportunity to contribute significantly to their Clinical Trials Management System (Oncore) by automating the creation of invoiceable items. Leveraging my skills in Python, Selenium, and OCRs, I developed a robust system that streamlined the process, resulting in substantial cost savings and generating incremental annual revenue exceeding $500,000.</p>
                        <p>My primary focus was to create automated workflows that eliminated manual data entry tasks and reduced the margin for error. By employing Selenium, I crafted scripts to navigate through the Oncore interface seamlessly, interacting with various elements to input and retrieve data efficiently. Additionally, I integrated OCR technology to extract pertinent information from scanned documents, further enhancing the automation process.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges, such as adapting the automation scripts to handle diverse document formats and optimizing their performance for large datasets. However, through persistence and problem-solving, I was able to overcome these obstacles and deliver a solution that exceeded expectations.</p>

                        <p>During my internship at Digital Global Systems from May 2022 to August 2022, I undertook various projects aimed at enhancing the functionality and efficiency of radio frequency boards.</p>
                        <p>One of my primary responsibilities involved developing programs in C to adjust the gain levels of radio frequency boards. Through meticulous coding and rigorous testing, I successfully implemented algorithms that precisely modulated the gain settings, improving the performance and reliability of the boards.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I spearheaded the optimization of a Python program designed to record and graph gain data obtained from the radio frequency boards. By leveraging advanced libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I streamlined data processing and visualization, enabling our team to extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions regarding board calibration and performance monitoring.</p>
                        <p>In addition to gain modulation, I played a pivotal role in data acquisition and analysis by creating Python scripts to download FCC frequency data and conduct thorough preprocessing and cleaning. These scripts automated the tedious task of collecting regulatory information, ensuring compliance and accuracy in our operations while saving valuable time for the team.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, I had the opportunity to showcase our work at the radio frequency conference in Las Vegas. Our optimized Python program, coupled with visually compelling graphs generated using Matplotlib, garnered significant attention and appreciation from industry experts, reaffirming the impact of our contributions on the RF engineering community.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the internship, I encountered various challenges, including debugging complex C programs and optimizing Python scripts for efficient data handling. However, through perseverance and collaboration with my colleagues, I was able to overcome these obstacles and deliver high-quality solutions that exceeded expectations.</p>
                        <p>This internship provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in software development, data analysis, and RF engineering within the telecommunications industry. It enhanced my proficiency in programming languages such as C and Python, as well as my familiarity with essential data manipulation tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.</p>
                        <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of this experience was witnessing the tangible impact of my contributions on the company's products and processes. Knowing that my work played a vital role in improving the performance and reliability of radio frequency boards was incredibly fulfilling and reinforced my passion for technology-driven innovation.</p>
                        <p>Overall, my internship at Digital Global Systems was a transformative journey that equipped me with practical skills, industry knowledge, and a strong foundation for future endeavors in the field of RF engineering and telecommunications. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of such a dynamic and forward-thinking team, and I look forward to applying the lessons learned to drive positive change in my career.</p>
