                        <p class="lead mb-5">Hello! I'm Jackson Rini and will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Colorado, Boulder in May 2024. Throughout my academic journey, I've delved deep into the captivating realm of computer science, including diverse topics ranging from algorithms and data structures to software engineering and artificial intelligence.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">My time at CU Boulder has been marked by enriching experiences, including engaging in various internships and projects. These opportunities have allowed me to collaborate within teams, acquire new skills on the go, and adeptly navigate unforeseen challenges.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">Beyond the realm of code, I'm deeply passionate about playing guitar, skiing, exercising in the gym, and reading literature, which provide balance and inspiration in my life. Whether it's learning songs on the guitar or observing different art forms, I find that diverse interests fuel creativity and enrich my perspective as a computer scientist.</p>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">As I embark on the next leg of my journey, I'm excited to find projects and challenges in which to immerse myself. I am committed to lifelong learning and continuous growth in the dynamic field of computer science. I'm eager to apply my skills and knowledge to make contributions to meaningful projects. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate!</p>

                            <p class="text-left">
                                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                                This project utilizes regression analysis to assess the depreciation rates of used car brands in Saudi Arabia, focusing on mileage as a determining factor. Two datasets were consolidated and cleaned to enhance data quality. Three regression models - Random Forest, Linear Regression, and XGBoost - were employed to predict car prices and evaluate depreciation rates. XGBoost emerged as the most accurate model, revealing insights into which car brands maintain their value best.
